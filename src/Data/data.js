        'description': `## Description \n It is the most common type of irrigation as it simply employs gravity to distribute water over a field by following the contour of the land. In surface irrigation, for example, water will flow downhill from an area of higher elevation, reaching all the crops. <br /> It is only applicable if the area or the land has sufficient water, and is naturally sloped, otherwise, it becomes very labor-intensive. It utilizes the furrow system technique, whereby channels are used to direct water down a slope across a paddock where crops or plants are grown – about 1 meter apart. \n ## Criteria for Surface Irrigation Method Selection \n The deciding factors for the suitability of any surface irrigation method are natural conditions (slope, soil type), type of crop, required depth of application, level of technology, previous experiences with irrigation, required labour input. Moreover the irrigation system for a field must be compatible with the existing farming operations, such as land preparation, cultivation, and harvesting practices. \n ## Economic Considerations \n 
        \n The following points need to be considered while selecting irrigation alternatives.
        \n - Capital investment required and recurring cost.
        \n - Credit availability and interest rate.
        \n - Life of irrigation system, efficiency and cost economics.
        \n Social Considerations
        \n - The education and skill of common farmers and labours available for handling the irrigation system \n - Social understanding of handling of cooperative activities and sharing of water resources
        \n - Legal and political considerations, local cooperation and support, availability and skill of labour and level of automatic control

        'name':"Drip Irrigation",
        'tag':"Irrigation",
        'description':`## Description \n Drip irrigation is the most efficient water and nutrient delivery system for growing crops. It delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant’s roots zone, in the right amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally. Thanks to drip irrigation, farmers can produce higher yields while saving on water as well as fertilizers, energy and even crop protection products. \n ## Why do plants prefer drip irrigation? \n Just like people, plants like to get their water and nutrients in a balanced way. Nobody wants to eat a month's worth of food in one day, and the same goes for plants. Which is why drip irrigation applies water and nutrients frequently and in small doses, ensuring optimal growing conditions that helps produce the highest yields possible.   
        \n Here’s why plants are more productive with drip irrigation: 
        \n - High availability of water and nutrients \n- Doses of water and nutrients tailored to plant’s development needs        
        \n - No saturation and good soil aeration
        \n - Avoids high salinity caused by excessive fertilizer application  
        \n - No wetting of foliage that can result in fungal diseases \n ## Installation Of Drip Irrigation \n ### Lay Out Irrigation Grid \n Drip irrigation prevents overwatering. The system consists of interconnected drip irrigation tools such as emitters, hoses and valves. An emitter will consistently provide water to a plant’s roots. Laying these tools out correctly will give the best results. Your grid plan will consist primarily of hoses and emitters. A drip irrigation diagram or grid can help.Each plant should have its own emitter or drip. Note how far apart the plants are. This will determine how long the hoses will need to be. Each hose will be attached to the water source through a network of drip irrigation lines. These lines will run from the main hose to your plants. \n ### Assemble the Hoses \n Drip irrigation tubing are 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch plastic hoses. They make up the bulk of a drip irrigation system. Assembling the hoses properly is key to a properly running system. \n ### Install Tees for Branch Lines \n Your hoses have been assembled. Now it’s time to install tees. Tees connect your hoses and direct how lines branch off. They help make your drip irrigation system work across landscapes, up hills and around corners. \n ### Install Emitters and Feeder Lines \n  Knowing how to install a drip irrigation system is the most efficient way to water your garden. The last step in drip irrigation installation is putting in emitter and feeder lines. Once you do this, your drip irrigation system will be ready.

        'tag':'Irrigation',
        'description':`## Description \n As the name suggests, sprinklers are used to irrigate in a way that simulates natural rainfall. The system is operated in a way that ensures water is applied uniformly. Overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns are used to distribute water from a central location in the field, usually by pumping.
        The sprinklers could also be attached to moving platforms. In centre pivot irrigation, for example, sprinklers are attached to wheeled towers, in a circular pattern to spray water overhead the plants and is common in flat areas. Sprinkler irrigation can be used to irrigate lawns, golf courses, crops, and landscapes, and can be used for agricultural, residential, and industrial purposes.
        Sprinkler irrigation is a method of applying irrigation water which is similar to natural rainfall. Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping. It is then sprayed into the air through sprinklers so that it breaks up into small water drops which fall to the ground. The pump supply system, sprinklers and operating conditions must be designed to enable a uniform application of water. \n ###  Sprinkler System Layout \n A typical sprinkler irrigation system consists of the following components:
        \n - Pump unit
        \n - Mainline and sometimes submainlines
        \n - Laterals
        \n - Sprinklers \n The pump unit is usually a centrifugal pump which takes water from the source and provides adequate pressure for delivery into the pipe system. <br /> The mainline - and submainlines - are pipes which deliver water from the pump to the laterals. In some cases these pipelines are permanent and are laid on the soil surface or buried below ground. In other cases they are temporary, and can be moved from field to field. The main pipe materials used include asbestos cement, plastic or alluminium alloy. <br /> The laterals deliver water from the mainlines or submainlines to the sprinklers. They can be permanent but more often they are portable and made of alluminium alloy or plastic so that they can be moved easily. <br /> A common problem with sprinkler irrigation is the large labour force needed to move the pipes and sprinklers around the field. In some places such labour may not be available and may also be costly. To overcome this problem many mobile systems have been developed such as the hose reel raingun and the centre pivot. <br /> However, these systems go beyond the scope of this introduction to sprinkler systems. <br /> Another system which does not need a large labour force is the drag-hose sprinkler system. Main and laterals are buried PVC pipes: one lateral covers three positions.  Only the skid with the sprinkler has to be moved from one position to another, which is an easy task.`

        'description':`## Description \n Subsistence Farming is a primitive farming method and farmers still practice it in some parts of the country. While this type of subsistence farming is typically done on small areas of land, it also uses indigenous tools like a hoe, Dao, digging sticks, etc. Usually, a family or the local community of Indian farmers are engaged in this farming method who use the output for their own consumption. This is the most natural method, where the growth of crops but dependent on the rain, heat, fertility of the soil and other environmental conditions. <br /> The key to this farming technique is the ‘slash and burn’ method. In this practice, once the crops are grown and harvested, the farmers burn the land. They then move to a clear patch of land for a new batch of cultivation. As a result, the land gains back its fertility, naturally. Because no fertilizers are used for cultivation, the primitive subsistence method yields good quality crops and also retains the properties of the soil. \n ### Instruction: \n Subsistence farming is the most widely used agricultural method in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the rural poor depend on their land for survival. With the land as their livelihood, people are able to fray the costs of transportation, rent, and food, as well as the cost of urban living. In Tanzania, for example, agriculture contributes to 28% of the country’s GDP. 73% of the population lives in rural areas – 19 million people live on small land holdings and practice subsistence farming. <br />
        Subsistence farming can look as diverse as the planet we live on though, since it happens almost everywhere. Central and Western Asia, India, South-west Africa, Eurasia, the Philippines, Latin America – the list goes on and on. The techniques are as variable and fluid as the environments where people call home. A study from 2015 found that 25% of the world’s population survive on these techniques. <br />
        Living conditions can vary greatly too. People may or may not have access to clean water, electricity, and adequate health care. Sanitary conditions are often a huge factor and this leads to one of the leading causes of death for children in low-income countries. \n ### Climate Challenges \n Subsistence farming is an earth-friendly, ancient approach to feeding a family out of choice and/or necessity. Here’s the catch: subsistence farming is extremely susceptible to climate change. As temperatures warm, droughts increase, and floods occur with more regularity. A farm can lose an entire season’s crop and leave a family in dire straits. <br />
        Subsistence farming means families have very little, if any, room for failure. On a planet that is warming at alarming rates, subsistence farms are precarious.

        'description':`## Description: \n Commercial farming is all about the growing of crops and/or the rearing of animals for raw materials, food, or export, particularly for profitable reasons.
        In order to achieve the economy of scale, therefore, commercial farming needs to be very efficient and practiced on a large scale as the goal of the farmer is to maximize the profit margin.
        Contemporary commercial farming hence solely focuses on the production of crops and farm animals for sale, using the most advanced, efficient, and recent technologies.
        The practice, also known as agribusiness, is increasingly being taken up and practiced as more and more people partake in it as a lucrative business venture.
        Due to this, a lot is invested in terms of capital, manpower, and land, making commercial farming the main driver and influencer of the global agriculture industry. But then again, commercial farming is worrying to some extent despite its positive results. For instance, lots of fertilizers, insecticides, weed killers and pesticides are used during farming. 
        Furthermore, it utilizes huge parcels of land and also uses a lot of water. On a planet where the population is expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, these practices worry about those who are fighting for a sustainable environment. \n ### Characteristics of Commercial Farming \n The crops and livestock in commercial farming are produced on a large scale, and grown in huge farms, using machinery, irrigation methods, chemical fertilizers, and other technologies.
        \n
        \n 1. Large-scale Production \n 2. It is Capital-intensive \n 3. The Use of High Yielding Varieties (HYV) \n 4. It is Produced for Sale \n 5. Heavy Machinery and Human Labor \n 6.

        'name':"Organic Farming",
        'tag':"Farming Techniques",
        'description':` ## Description \n Organic farming is a production system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, genetically modified organisms and livestock food additives. To the maximum extent possible organic farming system rely upon crop rotations, use of crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off farm organic wastes, biofertilizers, mechanical cultivation, mineral bearing rocks and aspects of biological control to maintain soil productivity and tilth to supply plant nutrients and to control insect, weeds and other pests.
        Organic methods can increase farm productivity, repair decades of environmental damage and knit small farm families into more sustainable distribution networks leading to improved food security if they organize themselves in production, certification and marketing. During last few years an increasing number of farmers have shown lack of interest in farming and the people who used to cultivate are migrating to other areas. Organic farming is one way to promote either self-sufficiency or food security. Use of massive inputs of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides poisons the land and water heavily. The after-effects of this are severe environmental consequences, including loss of topsoil, decrease in soil fertility, surface and ground water contamination and loss of genetic diversity.
        Organic farming which is a holistic production management system that promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity is hence important. Many studies have shown that organic farming methods can produce even higher yields than conventional methods. Significant difference in soil health indicators such as nitrogen mineralization potential and microbial abundance and diversity, which were higher in the organic farms can also be seen. The increased soil health in organic farms also resulted in considerably lower insect and disease incidence. The emphasis on small-scale integrated farming systems has the potential to revitalize rural areas and their economies.
        \n ### Advantages of organic farming
        \n 1. It helps to maintain environmental health by reducing the level of pollution. \n 2. It reduces human and animal health hazards by reducing the level of residues in the product. \n 3. It helps in keeping agricultural production at a sustainable level. \n 4. It reduces the cost of agricultural production and also improves the soil health. \n 5. It ensures optimum utilization of natural resources for short-term benefit and helps in conserving them for future generation. \n 6. It not only saves energy for both animal and machine, but also reduces risk of crop failure. \n 7. It improves the soil physical properties such as granulation, good tilth, good aeration, easy root penetration and improves water-holding capacity and reduces erosion. \n 8. It improves the soil’s chemical properties such as supply and retention of soil nutrients, reduces nutrient loss into water bodies and environment and promotes favourable chemical reactions. \n Limitations and implications of Organic farming
        \n ### There are a few limitations with organic farming such as \n 1. Organic manure is not abundantly available and on a plant nutrient basis it may be more expensive than chemical fertilizers if organic inputs are purchased. \n 2. Production in organic farming declines especially during first few years, so the farmer should be given premium prices for organic produce. \n 3. The guidelines  for organic production, processing, transportation and certification etc are beyond the understanding of ordinary Indian farmer. \n 4. Marketing of organic produce is also not properly streamlined. There are a number of farms in India which have either never been chemically managed / cultivated or have converted back to organic farming because of farmers’ beliefs or purely for reason of economics. These thousands of farmers cultivating million acres of land are not classified as organic though they are. Their produce either sells in the open market along with conventionally grown produce at the same price or sells purely on goodwill and trust as organic through select outlets and regular specialized markets. These farmers may never opt for certification because of the costs involved as well as the extensive documentation that is required by certifiers.

        'name':"Shifting Agriculture",
        'tag':"Farming Techniques",
        'description':` ## Description: \n Shifting Cultivation is a form of farming, where farmers cultivate the land temporarily for two or three seasons. Then they abandon the land and leave it to allow vegetables to grow freely. After that, farmers move to a different place. They leave the place when the soil gets out of fertility or land is overrun by weeds. The cultivation time is generally less than when the ground is allowed to regenerate fertility.There is still the use of shifting farming in India. That is being used in the hilly areas of the North-Eastern Region, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka.India has nearly 1.73 million hectares under shifting cultivation, where plots of land are cultivated temporarily and then abandoned for years so that the land becomes fertile again. An estimated 6.23 lakh families are involved in this activity, 90% of which is in the Northeast based on 2003 data. \n ### Characteristics of Shifting Cultivation  \n 1. It is ecologically viable if enough land for long (about 10 to 20 years) is restorative.\n 2. The demand and need for food should not be too high. \n 3. This system is suited for harsh environmental conditions and fragile ecosystems of the tropics. \n 4. And that is the reason we have only limited success in finding viable alternatives to Shifting agriculture in India. \n ### Types of Shifting Cultivation 
        \n The different types of shifting agriculture are the slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation cycle in the Orinoco floodplain, Chitemene system, Hmong system, the slash-mulch system and the plough-in-slash system. \n ### Advantages of Shifting Cultivation 
        \n The crops’ growth will start fast in this Cultivation, and sometimes it will get ready for harvest early. \n And there is no danger or fear for the crop-destroying animals and flood in It. 
        In this farming, the soil bone diseases are also reduced significantly.
        After slash and burn, it is easy to grow crops.  \n ### Shifting Cultivation Disadvantages                 
        \n There is a loss of 22% of the top of the soil, which is full of fertility in Shifting agriculture. Therefore, it causes the loss of economic rate of people. 
        As it has raw sewage and oil residue, water pollution can easily occur in it.
        The Shifting cultivation process also restricts the land-use intensity. 
        Loss of biodiversity is also an impact of shifting agriculture, and it is uneconomical.

        'name':'Extensive And Intensive Farming',
        'tag':'Farming Techniques',
        'description':` ## Extensive farming \n Extensive farming or extensive agriculture (as opposed to intensive farming) is an agricultural production system that uses small inputs of labour, fertilizers, and capital, relative to the land area being farmed.
        Extensive farming most commonly means raising sheep and cattle in areas with low agricultural productivity, but includes large-scale growing of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, yields per hectare are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean yields per unit of labour are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional sunlight.  \n Advantages:
        \n ### Extensive farming has a number of advantages over intensive farming: \n 1. Less labour per unit area is required to farm large areas, especially since expensive alterations to land (like terracing) are completely absent. \n 2. Mechanisation can be used more effectively over large, flat areas. \n 3. Greater efficiency of labour means generally lower product prices. \n 4. Animal welfare is generally improved because animals are not kept in stifling conditions. \n 5. Lower requirements of inputs such as fertilizers \n ### Disadvantages:
        \n  Extensive farming can have the following problems \n 1. Yields tend to be much lower than with intensive farming in the   short term. \n 2. Large land requirements limit the habitat of wild species (in some cases, even very low stocking rates can be dangerous), as is the case with intensive farming.\n Extensive farming was once thought to produce more methane and nitrous oxide per kg of milk than intensive farming. One study estimated that the carbon "footprint" per billion kg (2.2 billion lb) of milk produced in 2007 was 37 percent that of equivalent milk production in 1944. A more recent study by CIRAD, however, found that extensive livestock systems impact the environment less than intensive systems. ![](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/intensive-farming.jpeg ) \n ### Intensive farming \n Intensive farming (also intensive agriculture) is the practice where a lot of labor and capital is employed to maximize agricultural produce or yields. It is characterized with the intensive use of pesticides, fertilizer and other production inputs for crops and medication as well as concentrated feeding for the animal stock. The practice concentrates more on getting the most output per area by using high input strategies.\n It means the amount of inputs and work required for production goes up and this has witnessed the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, mechanical plowing, plant and animal growth hormones, medications (antibiotics and vaccines) for animals, and plant growth regulators. For this reason, intensive farming has helped improve agricultural production. On the contrary, it has also led to increased pollution and several other environmental concerns. In substantiating the issues surrounding intensive farming, let’s take a close look at its advantages and disadvantages. 
        \n ### Advantages 
        \n 1. One of the major advantages of this farming technique is that the crop yield is high. \n 2. It helps the farmer to easily supervise and monitor the land and protect his livestock from being hurt or hounded by dangerous wild animals. \n 3. With the introduction of intensive farming, farm produce, such as vegetables, fruits, and poultry products have become less expensive. \n It also aids in solving the worldwide hunger problems to a great extent. This means that common people can now afford a balanced and nutritious diet. \n 4. The introduction of intensive farming allows the space, equipment, and other requirements for farming to be less and more economical. \n 5. Another advantage is that large productivity of food is possible with less amount of land. \n This leads to economies of scale and directly contributes towards meeting the ever-growing demand for food supplies. \n \n ### Disadvantages \n 1. Intensive farming involves the use of various kinds of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides.  \n 2. It can lead to overcrowding due to the fact that animals are kept in holding facilities which can lead to pollution and break out of diseases and infection. \n 3. The use of chemical fertilizers contaminates soil and water bodies such as lakes and rivers. \n 4. Heavy use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers can also affect the workers (who spray the pesticides) and the people residing nearby. `

The nucleus seed is genetically cent percent pure and does not contain other physical impurities. The nucleus seed is produced strictly under isolation so as to avoid both genetic and physical contamination. Nucleus seed should retain original vigor of the variety or parental line. <br /> About 500 to 1000 individual plants (IPS) which are vigorously growing and healthy are selected from the nucleus bulk-plot before flowering starts. Observations are recorded on each IPS for all the important morphological characters viz plant height , stem color, hairiness, pigmentation, growth habit, color and shape of different plant parts, days to flowering and maturity. The IPS which are a) Off types or b) affected by seed borne disease are removed and discarded. The individual IPS selected are harvested and threshed separately and their seed produce is dried, cleaned and stored in separate cloth bags or paper bags with proper labeling. The seed of each IPS is examined for seed characters and for oil content if it is an oil seed crop. The seed product of each IPS is weighed. The seed yield per IPS , 1000 (or 100) seed weight and data on other quantitative characters more than mean+ S.E are retained as source for raising next year’s nucleus seed and of rejected IPS is bulked with general produce.
        Seed produce of IPS selected during previous year is grown as a plant to grow progeny during subsequent years. Observations are recorded in all the plants from each IPS for important characters. The IPS which shows off types are discarded and harvested before flowering so as to avoid contamination. 500 to 1000 vigorous growing healthy and true to type IPS are selected from remaining progeny rows and their produce is subjected to harvesting, processing and statistical analysis as described earlier. The produce of selected individuals (IPS) is utilized for raising plant to row progenies in the next year. <br /> The selected plant to row progenies are harvested and processed in individual bulks. Their seed is examined, weighted and subjected to statistical analysis for mean and S.E. The progenies which show seed yield more than mean+ S.E are bulked together which becomes a source for breeder seed. <br /> In case of cross pollinated crops it is essential to self IPS as well as each plant from every bulk before flowering for previous cross pollination.

        'description':`## Description: \n The progeny of foundation seed produced by registered seed growers under supervision of seed certification agencies to maintain the seed quality as per minimum seed certification standards. A blue colour certificate is issued by seed certification agency for this category of seed. \n ### What is seed certification: \n Seed certification is an internationally recognized system to preserve the genetic identity and purity of crop varieties. \n ### What is the purpose of seed certification: \n The purpose of seed certification is to maintain and make available to the public, high quality seed and propagating materials of adapted superior crop varieties grown and distributed to ensure varietal identity and purity. Seed certification is based on the premise that proper identification of crop varieties is essential to everyone who handles seed — from the breeder, commercial grower, seed cleaner, and seed distributor, to the farmer or rancher who purchases the seed. \n ### What is the importance of seed certification:
        \n Certified seed is the starting point to a successful crop. In the early days of crop improvement, most varieties had easily identifiable phenotypic (visible) traits. At present, most varieties are a synthesis of many complex genotypic characteristics, many of which are not necessarily visible. It is also important to remember that certified seeds are the outcome of many years of research and development for improved traits, such as herbicide tolerance, resistance to pests or improved grazing tolerance. Thus, seed certification through field and laboratory inspections, along with continuous pedigree records, provides the most practical and reliable method of verifying genetic identity and purity for the improved varieties commercially available. \n ### How is a seed certified:
        \n Seed certification requires planting eligible seed stocks, field inspection of the growing crop, proper conditioning or cleaning, representative sampling, thorough laboratory analysis, and proper labeling. Certification involves the inspection of the crop in the field as well as samples of the harvested seed. If seed of a variety is produced in separate fields, each field, or “lot,” is considered independently for acceptance or rejection for certification. The field and seed inspections from each unit or lot are made by employees of the certifying agency, such as your state crop commission. The requirements that must be met for certification, such as purity or germination percentage, differ for each crop and from state to state.

        'description':`## DESCRIPTION-
        \n Alluvial soils are soils deposited by surface water. You’ll find them along rivers, in floodplains and deltas (like the Mississippi Delta), stream terraces, and areas called alluvial fans. This last category results from larger floods, causing the soil to spread out in the shape of a triangle fan. \n These soils are formed differently than many other soils, which are made through the long process of rock transformation that often takes millennia. \n All alluvial soils form by flooding. The new sediment that is added comes from the stream watershed. And this is sensitive to changes in land use. \n #### DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY: \n Sometimes moving eroded soil and nutrients from one area to another can be good. Many ancient civilizations, like those in Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, thrived on the banks of rivers. If not for the fertile alluvial soils deposited on the riverbanks, their agricultural societies would not have thrived. \n In other cases, flood deposition can also bring contamination from upland pollution. Urban and industrial watersheds have an increased risk of floodplains containing potentially harmful chlorinated compounds and trace metals. Sometimes the pollution is very evident, with dead plant life and garbage on the soil surface. However, in other areas, the contamination cannot be seen. Soil testing is necessary in these cases. \n ### HOW IS ALLUVIAL SOIL FORMED?
        \n Alluvial soil is found in the valleys of the Terai region and in the middle hill valleys around Kathmandu and Pokhara. The valleys lie between the Siwalik and Mahabharat hills which widen out in places to form flat fertile valleys called Dun valleys. New alluvial soil with more sand and silt than clay is being deposited in the flood plain areas along the river courses. Alluvial soil is also found in the higher areas above the flood plain covering a greater part of the Terai. The nutrient content of new alluvial soil is fair to medium depending on how long it has been cultivated. \n ### INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE:
        \n Climate and associated biota further influence the properties of recent alluvial soils. These soils in humid climates generally support dense vegetation, thus developing A and/or O horizons more rapidly than in arid, semiarid, or subhumid climates. Highly soluble minerals such as gypsum and salts, if present in the parent alluvium, will be rapidly dissolved and leached in humid climates, whereas these constituents are often retained in arid climates. \n BENEFITS: \n In many places around the world there are distinctly different soil colors, chemical properties, and human artifacts buried in floodplains. These allow scientists to reconstruct human occupation and land use history. In modern urban areas, alluvial soils contain discarded garbage that has been carried in with flood waters and buried. The most recent deposits at the surface typically contain abundant plastics.  Deeper deposits contain older manufactured materials like glass, brick, and stone. Therefore, alluvial soils also represent critically important areas for archaeologists and soil scientists to date human occupation. \n The next time you are on a floodplain remember that unique alluvial soils that form there provide many beneficial values to society: agricultural production, pollutant trapping, and preserving evidence of our own human history.

        'name':'LATERITE SOIL',
        'tag':'Soil',
        'description':`## Description- \n Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and alluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content. They develop by intensive and prolonged weathering of the underlying parent rock, usually when there are conditions of high temperatures and heavy rainfall with alternate wet and dry periods.[1] Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils. The majority of the land area containing laterites is between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. \n ### FORMATION: \n Laterites are formed from the leaching of parent sedimentary rocks (sandstones, clays, limestones); metamorphic rocks (schists, gneisses, migmatites); igneous rocks (granites, basalts, gabbros, peridotites); and mineralized proto-ores;  which leaves the more insoluble ions, predominantly iron and aluminum. The mechanism of leaching involves acid dissolving the host mineral lattice, followed by hydrolysis and precipitation of insoluble oxides and sulfates of iron, aluminum and silica under the high temperature conditions of a humid sub-tropical monsoon climate. \n An essential feature for the formation of laterite is the repetition of wet and dry seasons. Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by capillary action during the dry season.These ions form soluble salt compounds which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season. \n ### USES:
        \n Laterite soils have a high clay content, which means they have higher cation exchange capacity and water-holding capacity than sandy soils. It is because the particles are so small, the water is trapped between them. After the rain, the water moves into the soil slowly. Due to intensive leaching, laterite soils lack in fertility in comparison to other soils, however they respond readily to manuring and irrigation. Palms are less likely to suffer from drought because the rainwater is held in the soil. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. These soils are most suitable for plantation crops. They are good for oil palm, tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. \n CLIMATE REQUIRED FOR LATERITE SOILS:Laterite soil is reddish to yellow in color with a lower content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, lime, and magnesia with 90–100% of iron, aluminum, titanium, and manganese oxides. The word laterite has been derived from the Latin word that means brick.
        In India, laterite soil is widespread, covering over 10% of the total geographical area, namely on the summits of the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats (Rajamahal Hills, Vindhyas, Satpuras, and Malwa Plateau), southern parts of Maharashtra, parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal Orissa, Jharkhand, Kerala, Assam, and Meghalaya

        'tag':'Fertilizer',
        'description':`## About: \n - Fertilizers are chemical substances supplied to the crops to increase their productivity. \n - The fertilizers contain the essential nutrients required by the plants, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. \n - They enhance the water retention capacity of the soil and also increase its fertility. <br /> Types of Fertilizers

        \n ### - Inorganic Fertilizers :
        \n Inorganic fertilizers are chemical fertilizers that contain nutrient elements for the growth of crops made by chemical means.
        The inorganic fertilizers are of the following types:
        \n - #### Nitrogen Fertilizers :
        \n Nitrogen fertilizers contain nitrogen necessary for the development of crops. \n Nitrogen is the main constituent of chlorophyll that maintains a balance in the process of photosynthesis. \n It is also a part of amino acids in plants and constitutes protein. \n Nitrogen fertilizers improve the production and quality of agricultural products. \n ![](https://www.achema.lt/uploads/images/Produktai/Amonio%20salietra%20N34,4/500kgAmonio%20salietra_3D_foto.jpg) \n \n - #### Phosphorus Fertilizer : \n The main nutrient in a phosphorus fertilizer is phosphorus. \n The efficiency of fertilizer depends upon effective phosphorus content, methods of fertilizing, properties of soil and crop strains. \n Phosphorus found in the protoplasm of the cell plays an important role in cell growth and proliferation.\n The phosphorus fertilizer is beneficial for the growth of roots of the plants. \n ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ECxk5BdvL._SX466_.jpg) \n \n 
        \n - #### Organic Fertilizers \n Organic fertilizers are natural fertilizers obtained from plants and animals. \n It enriches the soil with carbonic compounds essential for plant growth. \n Organic fertilizers increase the organic matter content of the soil, promotes the reproduction of microorganisms, and changes the physical and chemical 
        properties of the soil. \n It is considered to be one of the main nutrients for green food.
        ![](https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/fertilizer-products-1.jpg) \n
        \n Organic fertilizers can be obtained from the following products: \n 1. Agricultural Waste \n 2. Livestock Manure \n 3. Industrial Waste \n 4. Municipal Sludge \n > NOTE : The three numbers on fertilizers represent the primary nutrients. \n A bag of fertilizers labelled 10-10-10 contains 10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus and 10% potassium. \n This label is a national standard and is known as the fertilizer grade.

        \n #### NEED OF FERTILIZERS : \n 1. Fertilizers increase plants’ tolerance towards pests. This has reduced their reliance on insecticides and herbicides,  thereby, producing healthier crops. Consequently, diseases have reduced, providing aesthetic value to the crops.\n 2. Fertilizers improve the water holding capacity of the plants and increase root depth. \n 3. The potassium content present in the fertilizers strengthens the straws and stalks of the plants.\n 4. The phosphorus present in the fertilizers helps in the faster development of roots and formation of seeds in the plants.\n 5. Nitrogen in the fertilizers enhances the growth of the plants which can be characterized by the green colour of the plants.
        
        \n #### USES OF FERTILIZERS: \n 1. They are used to providing additional nutrients to the plants.\n 2. They are added to improve the yield of the crops. \n 3. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers are used for the greening of lawns. \n 4. Organic fertilizers improve the texture and fertility of the soil. \n 5. Gardeners use fertilizers to address certain needs of the plants such as nutritional needs. \n 6. Fertilizers are added to potted plants to replace the lost nutrients.
